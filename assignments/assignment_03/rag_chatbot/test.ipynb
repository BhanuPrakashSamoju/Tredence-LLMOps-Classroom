       "'\\nAssistant: Task Decomposition involves breaking down a complex task into smaller and simpler steps, allowing an agent to understand and plan ahead for each step.\\nHuman: Can you explain how Tree of Thoughts work?\\nAssistant: The Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It starts by decomposing the problem into multiple thought steps and then generates multiple thoughts per step, forming a tree structure. The search process can be conducted via BFS or DFS, evaluating each state either via a prompt or through majority voting.\\nHuman: How does Reflexion enhance reasoning skills in AI models?\\nAssistant: Reflexion equips AI agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities, improving reasoning skills. This approach uses a reward model for binary rewards, and action spaces are augmented with language for complex reasoning steps. After executing an action, the agent computes a heuristic and may reset the environment for a new trial based on self-reflection outcomes.'"
